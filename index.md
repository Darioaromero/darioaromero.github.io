I am a Postdoctoral associate based in New York University - Abu Dhabi. I am an applied economist focusing on political economy, economic history, and development. My research explores the complex interactions between political and economic institutions and their impact on economic outcomes in developing countries. I investigate the effects of external shocks, such as violence, media influence, and foreign military policies, on social behavior and institutional outcomes. I have explored a variety of contexts, from peace agreements and military incentives to international trade and media ownership. My methodological approach emphasizes causal identification, utilizing quasi-experimental designs and econometric techniques to analyze data rigorously. Ultimately, my research is driven by the fundamental questions surrounding the interplay of historical events, political dynamics, and economic conditions, aiming to contribute to a deeper understanding of how these factors shape societal outcomes and economic development.
