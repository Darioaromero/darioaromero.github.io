I am an Economics Ph.D student at Columbia University in the City of New York.
I hold a M.A. in Economics  and B.A. in Economics and Political Science from Universidad de los Andes.

My interest is in political economy, development economics, and applied microeconomics. I have focused my research on the economic and political consequences of conflict and crime, and I have worked on evaluations for education policies in Latin America.
